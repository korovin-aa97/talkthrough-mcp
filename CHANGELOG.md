## [Unreleased]

Everything below ships as `v0.1.0` at the first public release (this section
is renamed to `[0.1.0] — <date>` when the tag is cut).

### Added

- Deterministic local pipeline: ffprobe validation → wall-clock resolution →
  faster-whisper STT (timestamped segments) → one-pass scene keyframes
  (scaled ≤1568 px) → dHash dedup → RapidOCR of unique frames →
  `talkthrough-manifest/v1`.
- Content-addressed job store (`~/.talkthrough/jobs/<sha256[:16]>`):
  idempotent `process_media`, instant re-calls, `gc`.
- Wall-clock ladder: `recorded_at` override → QuickTime creationdate tag →
  container `creation_time` → mtime−duration; `t_wall` on every timestamped
  output.
- 7 MCP tools (`process_media`, `get_transcript`, `get_frames`, `get_moment`,
  `search`, `extract_frame`, `list_jobs`) with 10-15 usage examples embedded
  in every description (unit-gated); `get_moment`/`search` pick a
  window-representative frame, not the nearest cross-scene keyframe.
- 5 server prompts (`triage-recording`, `spec-from-workshop`,
  `backlog-from-demo`, `meeting-actions`, `correlate-with-logs`), mirrored in
  `examples/prompts/` with a no-drift test.
- Multilingual support: language auto-detection with `language_probability`
  in manifest and summary; per-call `model=` parameter validated against the
  faster-whisper alias list (incl. `large-v3-turbo`); prompts mandate digests
  in the narrator's language with verbatim quotes; on-screen-text OCR script
  packs via `TALKTHROUGH_OCR_LANG` / `TALKTHROUGH_OCR_PARAMS`.
- CLI: `serve` (stdio MCP, default) / `process [--json] [--model]` / `gc`.
- ffmpeg resolution ladder with pip-only `static-ffmpeg` fallback; OCR
  gracefully disables (`TALKTHROUGH_OCR=off` or import failure).
- Engine-agnostic integrations: `integrations/<engine>/` for 12 MCP clients,
  a full Claude Code plugin, the cross-engine agent skill
  (`.agents/skills/talkthrough/`), `AGENTS.md`, `llms-install.md`, `llms.txt`,
  and the MCP-registry `server.json` — every artifact generated from one
  source of truth (`scripts/gen_integrations.py`) and byte-pinned by tests,
  including the README install matrix.
- Examples: genericized triage agent, findings-contract JSON Schema,
  composition patterns, GitHub-issues recipe.
- Docs: FAQ + Limitations in README, `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`,
  `docs/DESIGN.md`; PEP 561 `py.typed` marker.
- CI: ubuntu (lint, mypy strict, unit + integration + e2e over committed
  synthetic EN/RU fixtures) + macos (lint, unit) + windows best-effort smoke;
  actions pinned by commit SHA; release workflow via PyPI Trusted Publishing
  (inert until the first `v*` tag).
